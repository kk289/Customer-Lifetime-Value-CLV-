## Recommending Items to Users

Collaborative Filtering is a popular technique that is used for coming up with User-Item recommendations. 

We will use the list of which users bought which items and build an affinity score between items. When a customers buys an item, we use this affinity score to recommend other items to the customer

The source data set ("rating.csv") contains in each row a User ID and an Item ID. This is the list of users and the items they bought, one line at a time.
